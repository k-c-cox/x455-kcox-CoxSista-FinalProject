                    <p> Japan had long been a top destination on our bucket list, and in October 2019, we finally made it there! We almost had to cancel the trip right before we were scheduled to leave due to Typhoon Hagibis, which caused widespread destruction in some areas in Japan. Luckily, our travel plans could proceed, and we arrived in Osaka on October 13th to shockingly blue skies. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the course of our two weeks in Japan, we explored everything from the hustle and bustle of the larger cities Osaka and Tokyo and the historic Kyoto to more laid-back areas like Nara's famous deer park and quaint Kurashiki. A definite favorite of our trip was Naoshima. Once a quiet fishing island in the Seto Inland Sea, it's now home to many world-class contemporary art museums, outdoor sculpture installations, and great architecture. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There was a lot to explore: historic castles, beautiful shrines, art installations, food markets, quiet side streets -- and even more delicious food to be eaten. Below you'll find our trip log.

                    <h3>Osaka</h3>
                    <p>Landed at Osaka’s Kansai Airport. Flight was delayed 2 hours due to Typhoon Hagibis, but it was bright blue sky when we landed and could see no signs of damage -- apparently, it mainly hit Tokyo. </p>
                    <p>After getting through immigration and exchanging money we took the train into the JR Namba station and then had a 5 min walk to our Airbnb. Pretty compact space but the location was great in Americamura -- lots of places to eat and shop right around and about a 5 min walk to be in the heart of Dotonbori. We took a quick stroll through the neighborhood before stopping at 7-11 to grab some yogurts for a snack before heading to bed. </p>
                    <p>Woke up and got breakfast at Eggs N’Things -- a Hawaiian chain :P was close to the Airbnb and had lots of options for Cameron. Then we wandered through Dotonbori to get to the Kamigata Ukiyoe Museum. Very small museum near Dotonbori that featured a collection of block prints mainly of Kabuki actors. After we wandered through the neighborhood and up through the Shinshibashi shopping area. Went back to the Airbnb to use the WiFi (since we still hadn’t gotten our Pocket Wifi as the delivery got messed up due to the typhoon). We then headed up to the Osaka Museum of Housing and Living. A cool museum where they set up a recreation of what a town in the Edo period would look like. Had examples of a few different shops set up, what a wealthy merchant’s house would look like, and examples of tenements. There was a group of cute little old ladies who pulled us over to do demonstrations on how to tie a kimono which was cool to see. Takes a lot to get it looking just right and then is super easy to take off. After the museum, we took the subway back to the Airbnb. We then went and got foot massages before heading out to have dinner at a chicken Yakitori place. The food was fine but not super noteworthy, very heavy on the charcoal flavor. </p>
                    <p>October 18th: Had a very leisurely morning since we had lots of jam packed days back to back. Ended up headed to Sushizamen in Dontonburi for lunch. Michael and Becca arrived in Osaka and met us there. Definitely learned that they fall in the travel to eat category, had an impressive amount of sushi. Despite being a place were gluten-free peeps have said they’ve been able to eat the waiter told Cameron she couldn’t have the sushi so she ended up having shashimi. After our lunch we wandered around the area a bit with Michael and Becca. Then we took the subway to go to Horikoshi Shrine, small shrine in the heart of the city. We then walked over to Harukas building. There’s a terrace garden on the 16th floor that it’s free to go up to and there’s a nice view overlooking the city from there. Afterwards we wandered over to the Shinsekai area, started to rain as we were walking over there, but still fun to see. Then it was back to Dotonburi to meet up with the whole group (Michael, Becca, their friend Tanya, Matt, Chanchira, and baby Calvin). Got dinner as a big group and a not so amazing place that was on the 2nd level of basement. Pretty sure we overwhelmed the waitress.

                        src="./images/japan/places-11.png" alt="Nara" /></span>
                    <h3>Nara</h3>
                    <p>Headed to the train station to go to Nara. Fairly quick and easy ride to get there. Once in Nara, we walked from the station down a street with lots of shops and cafes before making a quick stop at Kōfuku-ji, mainly known for its 5 story Pagoda. We then continued on to Nara Park. There were deer absolutely everywhere! Never seen anything quite like it. Went to Todaji temple next. It’s one of the world’s largest wooden structures and contains the largest Bronze image of Buddha in the world. We both really enjoyed watching people try to climb through a small hole in a wooden pillar in the back of the temple - it is said that if you successfully make it through you’ll have good luck for the rest of your life. Afterward, we tried to get lunch at a sushi place that was mentioned by the person Cameron got her gluten-free Japanese card from but it was closed. So wandered around for a bit trying to find some food. Another sushi place was all sold-out. Finally ended up getting Matcha boba and mochi -- aka the lunch of champions. While eating my mochi a deer came right up to me and kept trying to get me to feed it. When I didn’t it started eating the strap of my purse! We then made our way to Kasuga-taisha Shrine, which is known for its 10,000 lanterns. They only lite them twice a year during festivals but we really enjoyed wandering through the grounds and seeing it. Headed back to the main part of Nara park where we bought some deer crackers and feed the deer, they can get pretty aggressive. Then it was back to the train station where we caught the train back to Osaka. Since we ended up not having sushi for lunch we tried to get sushi at a place in the train station where you order by putting numbered tags corresponding to the sushi you want in the basket, except they told Cameron she couldn’t eat it since they put malt vinegar into the rice...womp womp. So I had a couple of pieces before we left to look for another place. We went from sushi place to sushi place for almost an hour, getting turned away from each since they said couldn’t do gluten-free, before giving up on sushi and going to the well-known King Crab restaurant in Dotonbori. Cameron got 6 grilled crab legs and I did crab tempura. Was a long day so it was back to the Airbnb and to bed.</p>

                    <h3>Naoshima</h3>
                    <p>October 17th we woke up and had breakfast in the little cafe at the Uno Port Inn, then it was across the street to the Ferry terminal to get on the 9:22am boat to Naoshima. Quick ride, about 20 mins to arrive at Miyaura port on the west side of the island. Got off and wandered around the port area for a little bit, checking out a couple of the art pieces like the red pumpkin etc. Then got on the bus to the Chichu Museum. They had extra buses running due to the Sentuchi Trienale going on, which was perfect for us since it meant a direct bus to the Chichu ticket office rather than having to go the long way around. Arrived at 10:40am which meant we could go ahead and exchange our online reservation tickets for our admission tickets and walk over to the entrance (they only allow you to do this 10 mins before your set time). The museum was really great, the architecture in itself was like an art piece. It doesn’t actually contain that much art all in all. There’s a room with 5 Monets, 3 James Turnell pieces, and X. But the juxtaposition of the art, brutalist architecture and nature was really interesting. One of the pieces felt a bit like a performance piece since they only let a little group go in at a time. They line you all up and then you go up a set of stairs into a room with a small slope down and it’s all about the play of light, which changes color periodically. After enjoying the museum we had lunch at the cafe and sat outside, you could tell a lot of waiguoren go there since they had a gluten-free option on the menu. Once we finished at Chichu we headed over to Benesse House to see the museum there before wandering around the grounds to see all the outdoor art installations. It was funny to see the line to take pictures at the famous yellow pumpkin sculptures. Once we got our picture we hopped on the bus again to head to Homura the port town on the east side of the island to explore the Art House Project. The Art House Project had taken 6 old houses in the town and invited artists in to each space to reimagine them. Was pretty interesting to wander through the entire town from house to house. Our favorite one, The Water, actually isn’t part of the Art House Project. It’s a newer installation that plays on the historic importance water had to life in the town and the decisions made in terms of the town’s urban planning. Once we finished up we headed back across the island to get the ferry back to Uno. We had 15 mins between ferry arrival and train departure so we speed walked to grab our stuff before hopping on the train to go back to Osaka. We got some really good Onigiri for a snack in Okayama while transferring trains, and regretted not getting more so it could have counted for our dinner. We arrived back to Osaka to the Shin-Osaka station right in the middle of rush hours to had a pretty squeezed subway ride to get to our new Airbnb. The location wasn’t as good since there wasn’t as much right around there and was further away from Dotonbori etc. We weren’t too hungry so we grabbed some yogurts at Family Mart and called it a night.

                    <h3>Kyoto</h3>
                    <p>Hopped on the train. By Shinkansen it only takes 13 mins to get to Kyoto station from Shin-Osaka station. Once we realized this Cameron and I regretted not heading up for the day, since we both felt like we had way more time than we needed in Osaka. When we arrived Becca wanted to get Matcha from a place that was recommended to her so we set out to find it...only we couldn’t figure out where it was. We wandered around the station for over 40mins before finally giving up and heading to our hotel to drop our stuff. Cameron and I then went on a short 5 min jaunt across the river to Choice Cafe, a vegan gluten free cafe for lunch where we both had 100% buckwheat soba. We then headed to the Imperial Palace, the grounds are absolutely massive and we tried to figure out where the entrance to the palace was in the grounds, but didn’t until it was too late and they weren’t allowing any more people to enter....whoops. Found Michael and Becca who had also wandered over. We then took the subway back towards our hotel and wandered through Gion. Was interesting since everything had screens and shutters so hard to tell what was what, also if anything was open. So seemed a little quiet. Continued our walk over to Yasaka Shrine. We were there right a sunset so got to see all the lanterns all lit. Cameron and I then made our way back to our hotel to check in. Everyone ended up doing their own thing for dinner, we went to Fortune Garden a lovely french fusion place near our hotel since we had done some research and knew they had gluten-free options for Cameron. Afterwards we wandered around the canal in the neighborhood on our way to In The Moon a rooftop bar. Thought others might join us, but ended up just being the two of us. Had our drinks while enjoying the view back across the river. Walked through Pontocho Alley on our way back to the hotel. 
                        !</p>
                    <p>October 21st: Woke up at 6:30ish so we could be ready and down to breakfast early. Then made our way via subway and train to Arashiyama in the northwest part of town to see the bamboo grove. Meet up with Becca and Michael there. Took a nice stroll through the grove with some photo op stops along the way. Then wandered down towards the river. Cameron and I then broke off from the group. Matt, Chanchira, and Calvin had just arrived and were headed to see the bamboo and Michael + Becca wanted to grab some food. Cameron and I took the bus, which we decided was our least favorite transportation option in Japan, to Ryoan-ji a famous rock garden. Was interesting to see but was a little smaller than we both anticipated. Then hopped on the bus again to get to Kinkaku-ji aka the gloden pavalion. Both of us were a little underwhelmed with it since it was very crowded and quite small, once you see it that’s pretty much it. Whereas at other temples and shrines there’s a lot more to see or so it feels like. By then we were pretty tired so headed to a Lawson’s to grab a snack, and ended up sitting at a table outside it for about 30mins. We met back up with Becca and Michael and made our way over to Nijo Castle via cab. Walked about 10 mins from there to go to a nice little tea house and have a matcha break. Then met up with Andie and Augie who had just arrived in Kyoto to go through Nijo. Was interesting to see the palace, lots of gold leaf decorations on the screens. The wooden floors are so old that as you walk on them the nails shift and makes it sound like there are birds singing. After we finished at Nijo we went to Kikiyo Sushi a small 3rd generation sushi restaurant which was able to accommodate gluten-free, needless to say Cameron was a very happy camper. Started raining in earnest by this point and we hopped on the bus to then head back towards pontocho area. We then went to a tiny little gin bar called Nokishita711 Gin and Cocktail Labo. It’s a one man operation with room for 12 people inside and only 4 seats. Was really quirky and cool. All the drinks were really unique. Cameron got one called the Botanical Garden which was served in a terrarium like thing with herbs and flowers. Mine was called Style Wars, which had an interesting mix of flavors from the gin, cacao, chile, yogurt… After the gin bar Anide, Augie, Cameron and I met up with Matt and Chanchira and looked for a place to grab a drink, wandered around for quite awhile - almost an hour but had no luck finding a place that would fit all of us + stroller. So ended up back at our hotel at the bar in the lobby.

                    <p>October 22nd: Originally had planned to get up to go to Fushimi-Inari but since it was forecasted to rain we decided we would go Wednesday morning instead. So had a more leisurely start then the previous day. Cameron and I went to Breizh Cafe Creperie near our hotel since they do 100% buckwheat galettes that she could have. Once we finished breakfast we headed over to Nishiki Market to meet up with the rest of the group. We had intended it to be a morning activity but we all really enjoyed wandering the market and trying things to eat so ended up staying multiple hours through lunch. We then hopped on the bus to Ginkaku-ji, the silver pavilion. Was pretty and had nice grounds/ viewpoints. After we did that walked down the Philosopher's path. The group then split with Becca, Michael, and Tanya headed to get dinner at a conveyor belt sushi place while the rest of us headed to the pontocho area to find a place to grab a drink. After our drink, Andie, Augie, Cameron, and I headed via cab to Kodai-ji temple which during different parts of the year do special entrances at night to see it all illuminated. The website was confusing and we thought that it had already started, got up there in the cab to be turned away and told it was closed. So we ended up wandering around the older part of town Higashiyama instead. Learned that Becca’s new iphone 11 has a really good camera with a night mode even. We then headed to Yankiku a restaurant that M + B went to on Sunday night near their hotel for dinner. It’s a grill place where you have a tableside grill and cook it all yourself. It was so so so good, probably the best meal we’ve had on the trip. Then headed back to the hotel to pack up all our stuff in prep for our early start in the morning.</p>
                    <p>October 23rd: Woke up bright and early at 6am. Had oatmeal/ yogurt for breakfast in the room as we finished packing up. Left our bags at our hotel and then walked over to the hostel (Piece Hostel Kyoto) where Michael and Becca were staying after they had to move from the Nest Hotel. Andie and Augie meet us there and we all shared a cab to Fushimi Inari. We arrived a little before 8am and there were already a good amount of people exploring, but not too crowded. We wandered the main shrine area before heading up the mountain through the tori gates, needless to say there were a lot of photo stops along the way. Made it up about halfway, which definitely felt like it should have been more than the halfway point. Andie and Michael were all for going to the top but Becca and I really weren’t for it so we went a little further to a viewpoint before heading down. By the time we got back to the main shrine it was very crowded so we were all glad that we had gotten there when we did. At this point we met up with Matt and Chanchira briefly before they went through the first part of the trail, while they did that the rest of us went through the little market that was set up near the shrine and grabbed some food before heading to a coffee shop for a matcha latte break. 

                        Then we headed to Kiyomizu Dera. We wandered through the temple, part of which is currently under renovation - the main hall. I really enjoyed wandering through it as there were many different sections to explore. Afterwards we wandered around higashiyama, the old quarter for a bit. Initially tried to find a spot for lunch but with Cameron’s dietary restrictions didn’t have much luck. At that point the group decided to split up to get lunch and then meet back up to catch the train to Tokyo. Cameron and I went back to the creperie near our hotel that we knew she could eat at. We grabbed our stuff from our hotel and walked with it to meet up with Becca and Michael at their hotel to share a cab to get to the train station. At the station we returned our Icoca cards and grabbed seat reservations in case we’d be unable to get seats all together in the unreserved cars. We weren’t able to grab seats together so we ended up walking the length of the train to get to our reserved seats. Cameron insta storied and napped during the ride while I wrote the first half of this doc. Couldn’t see Mt. Fuji from the train since it was too dark by the time we were passing it. Cameron and I split off from the group so we could check out a ramen place in the station that had gluten-free ramen. Cameron was a very happy camper. Then took the subway to get to the hotel and check-in. Freshened up a little bit before walking over to Tsukiji area to Sushizanmai for dinner with the group. Apparently there are 7 different locations all within a couple of blocks so Becca and Michael ended up going to the wrong location :P I had a lite sushi snack. After dinner we wandered around for a little bit in the neighborhood and found a small little wine bar to grab a drink. Along with the drinks Michael and I got sherbet that tasted like hi-chew candies while Cameron got a caprese salad with a big ball of burrata.

                    <h3>Tokyo</h3>
                    <p>Hopped on the subway to the Harujuku area. Andie, Augie, Cameron and I went to go wander around the Meji Shrine. Neither of us was super impressed with it but that may be because at that point we’d hit TMT, too many temples. Afterwards we wandered around Harujuku’s main shopping street for a bit before going to an animal cafe. At the cafe they had huge rabbits, chincillas, hedgehogs, and otters. The chinchillas were super soft. The otters made Cameron and me sad since they definitely didn’t seem like they had enough space. As we were wandering to meet up with Kiara and Rafael we stopped to get gelato that was shaped like animals, very cute but melted super quick. We all wandered around for a bit before Cameron and I broke off to find some lunch. We headed over to Little Bird cafe which was mentioned by almost everything we read about eating gluten free in Tokyo, both of us were underwhelmed. It was in a weird location and the space was odd. Also with Cameron’s soy allergy she was told she could only eat 2 things on the entire menu gyoza, and a weird prosciutto salad sandwich thing. We tracked down the rest of the group and we all went to Shibuya to participate and watch the Shibuya scramble. Andie had found an observation deck that was on the 7th or 8th floor of a building overlooking it so we hung out up there for awhile. After we did some shopping at the Don Quijote store, which is huge and has a little bit of everything. Then we headed back to wander around Harujuku for a little bit. We found a nice bar and ended up hanging out there for over 2 hours before we hopped in a cab to head back to the hotel since it had started to really rain at that point and none of us felt up to dealing with a long trip via subway. We were hungry so Becca, Michael, Cameron and I ended up going back to Sushizanmai, the waiter from the previous day recognized us. Cameron got excited since the waiter intitally told her she would be able to have the sushi only to come back later to inform her there was grain vinegar in the sushi rice. Finally made it back to the hotel after midnight where we promptly went to bed. </p>
                    <p>October 25th: Woke up to discover that it was pouring rain. Had breakfast at the hotel before getting on the subway/train to go over to the teamLab Borderless exhibition. Was crazy how many people were there especially since we arrived soon after it opened. We pretty much spent the entire morning wandering through all the exhibitions and really enjoyed it. Although did have to wait for awhile to get into some like the forest of lamps. Afterwards we all had lunch at a restaurant in the mall across the way. The mall was pretty funny since it was styled like the Venetian hotel is in Las Vegas. Afterwards headed to Ginza to wander around for a little while. Cameron and I explored Itoya a 12 floor stationary store. Meet up with the rest of the group at Matt and Chanchira’s hotel and after a long discussion we ended up eating out on the patio at the Italian restaurant downstairs since they had gluten-free options and could accommodate Calvin. Then we walked back to our hotel and packed up all our stuff. 
                    </p>
                    <p>October 26th: Last day :( We woke up and Cameron had breakfast at the hotel while I finished packing up. Then we meet up with Andie and Augie to go wander through Tsukiji fish market which was fun to see. I finally couldn’t resist and got myself a new knife (it’s really pretty since it has 63 layers of folded steel). This meant that I needed to make a quick stop at the Tax refund office in the market, where I had a funny conversation with the guy as to why my passport said I was born in China. Then it was back to the hotel to collect our stuff. We tried to make a stop at Happy Pancake but the wait was too long so we continued on to Tokyo station to go back to the Ramen place. After lunch we hopped on that Narita express train to get to the airport. </p>
